# TPMS Arduino code to read RF TPMS Sensors
![image](https://github.com/avicarmeli/TPMS-SDR/assets/32562196/2d5f958e-7c0f-45a7-ba11-a033dc294d37)

## Overview:
Some TPMS (Tyre Pressure Monitor System) sensors transmit RF data. Older car models (such as my Nissan Micra 2014) Have only warning light to indicate that the pressure of one of the tyres is too low.
It is possible to use [RTL-SDR](https://github.com/topics/rtl-sdr) with [RTL_433](https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433) to read the RF data.
Such implementation for Arduino boards and small display was assambled as a stand alone system ([Toyota TPMS project](https://www.hackster.io/jsmsolns/arduino-tpms-tyre-pressure-display-b6e544#toc-about-tpms-2)).

This Project will use ESP32 as the main Board together with CC1101 board to read TPMS data and to send that data over BLE so that data would be recived by eigther cellphone or Android car multimeda app that would display the data and generate needed alerts.

Specificly this project is aimed at forwording the TPMS data to [TPMS Advancved android app](https://github.com/VincentMasselis/TPMS-advanced).

## Intent:
- [X] Porting the code to ESP32.
- [X] Sending sensors data over BLE to imitate Sysgration BLE sensors so it can be displayed in cellphone app.

## Hardware:
### Components:
- ESP32 Dev kit such as [that.](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001929935550.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.70.2fcd1802a3JqO6)   -  4$

### Wiering:
See wiering diagram in [DOCS](https://github.com/avicarmeli/TPMS-SDR/blob/main/Docs/ESP-SDR%20connection%20diagram.md).

## Code:
### installation:
#### Prerequests:
- Arduino IDE.
- ESP32 Board (I use DEV Kit).
- CC1101 Board (I use 8 pins TZT CC1101).
- Install in Arduio IDE the following libraries:
  - TickTwo
  - BLEDevice
  - BLEUtils.h
  - BLEServer.h
- locate the directory where Arduino IDE stores the projects (for windows usually in Arduino folder under DOCS).
- Download Zip file of the repo using the Green **Code** pull down on the upper right corner of this page.
- Unzip the foldeer into the Arduino projects folder you located.

#### Configs:
- Opened Arduino IDE.
- Open the TPMS-SDR project.
- Navigate to the *configs.h* tab and at line 93 insert you RF TPMS ID for each tire.
- Make sure to select in the config.h file the type of car sensors you have.
- Under Tools menu select your board type.
- Connect your board to the USB port.
- Under the Tools menu select your COM port.

#### Upload:
- Hit the upload button on the upper left corner (right arrow icon).
- If there are any errors follow the messages (most likely it is missing library).
- Depend on the board you use you might need to manually put your board into upload mode (usually holding both push buttons then releasing the reset butteon and only after a second or so the other button).
- When upload is done you might need to reset the board again.
- Successful run will yield the next output:

#### Configuring TPMS advanced to recieve BLE data from TPMS SDR:
- Install [TPMS Advanced](https://github.com/VincentMasselis/TPMS-advanced/tree/dedad01dee84f4cdff2c9a677efd3221a9e1d25d) from [Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.masselis.tpmsadvanced) store.
- Open The app.
- On the upper left choose bind sensors then select SCAN QR Code Sysgration sensors.
- Scan This [QR](https://github.com/avicarmeli/TPMS-SDR/blob/main/Docs/TPMS%20Advanced%20QR%20code%20Format.md) code.
- You are done.
- Data will show up in the TPMS advanced app only when sensors are transmitting (some cars sensors transmit only after certain speed was reached).
